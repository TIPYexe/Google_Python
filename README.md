# Google Python Course Homework (Extracurricular)

This repository contains all the homework assignments completed during the Python course offered by Google in my second year of university. The course, not part of the official school program, provided comprehensive training and practical exercises to develop proficiency in the Python programming language.

The homework assignments cover a wide range of topics and concepts, including data types, control structures, functions, object-oriented programming, file handling, modules, and more. Each assignment is designed to reinforce the knowledge gained from the course and demonstrate practical implementation skills.
